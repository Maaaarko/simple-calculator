### About

The client is a simple web app consisting of numbered buttons and operator buttons. Input is sent to the server for evaluation.
The results are rounded to 6 decimal places. Last 5 results are displayed.
Most of the error messages specify the character where the parsing failed.

Appearance is influenced by iPhone calculator.

### Algorithm explanation

Input is first converted into tokens - token being an operand or an operator. All redundant operators are ommited and the expression is simplified.
It is then converted to postfix notation, aka Reverse Polish notation, using Dijkstra's Shunting yard algorithm.
The postfix expression is than calculated and result is returned to the client.
